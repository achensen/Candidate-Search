## Additional Notes 
 The initial code for this project was provided by EDX Engineering Services Company to complete an assignment for a Full Stack Web Development Course. My contribution was to complete the starter code and ensure it had full functionality similar to the mock up that was provided. I did receive tutoring assistance to help with my understanding of this assignment. One issue with this assignment is the required API, most of the values or null so it doesn't really look like that much information is actually available. Another item i got assistant on was making a grid with the typescript and react for the potencial candidates page, but it was a good learning experience to aim for the look of the mock up, and is the best way to display the information.
